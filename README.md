# Block-wise-GLM-Analysis-of-fMRI-Data
This repository contains a Python script for performing block-wise first-level GLM analysis of fMRI data using the Nilearn library. It extracts trial-by-trial beta maps for later multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), and is compatible with BIDS-formatted datasets.
